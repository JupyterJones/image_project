Generator Expression Syntax Fix
user
return sorted(fn for fn in listdir(volk_directory) if fn.endswith('.mp4'), reverse=True)
SyntaxError: Generator expression must be parenthesized
ChatGPT
The error occurs because the generator expression in the `sorted()` function must be enclosed in parentheses. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from os import listdir

volk_directory = "your_directory_path_here"  # Replace with your directory path

# Corrected code with parenthesis around the generator expression
video_files = sorted(
    (fn for fn in listdir(volk_directory) if fn.endswith('.mp4')),
    reverse=True
)

print(video_files)
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The generator expression `(fn for fn in listdir(volk_directory) if fn.endswith('.mp4'))` is now enclosed in parentheses. This is required to explicitly group the generator expression when passing it to a function like `sorted()`.

If you encounter any other issues or want further improvements, let me know!
