what is AtprotoClient and how is it used code example
ChatGPT
`AtprotoClient` appears to be a client for interacting with the **AT Protocol** (short for "Authenticated Transfer Protocol"), which is designed to facilitate decentralized social networking. It allows developers to perform operations such as posting, retrieving content, and managing data on services built on the AT Protocol ecosystem.

### Typical Use of `AtprotoClient`

The `AtprotoClient` class is part of a library that interfaces with AT Protocol services. Developers can use it to authenticate users, send requests, and handle responses in a structured manner.

---

### Example Usage

Below is a hypothetical example of how `AtprotoClient` might be used in Python, assuming the library is installed and properly configured:

```python
from atproto.client import AtprotoClient

# Initialize the client
client = AtprotoClient()

# Authenticate with username and password
try:
    client.login(username="your_username", password="your_password")
    print("Login successful!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during login: {e}")

# Create a post
try:
    post_response = client.create_post(
        text="Hello, AT Protocol! This is my first post.",
        visibility="public"
    )
    print(f"Post created successfully: {post_response}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error while creating post: {e}")

# Fetch posts
try:
    feed = client.get_feed(limit=10)
    for post in feed:
        print(f"Post by {post['author']}: {post['text']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error fetching feed: {e}")
```

---

### Key Features You Might Use

1. **Authentication**  
   Use `client.login()` or similar methods to authenticate a user with the AT Protocol server.

2. **Creating Content**  
   Functions like `client.create_post()` are used to create new posts or messages.

3. **Fetching Data**  
   Methods such as `client.get_feed()` or `client.get_post(post_id)` allow retrieval of posts and feeds.

4. **Managing User Profiles**  
   Manage or retrieve profile information using appropriate methods.

---

### Installation

To use `AtprotoClient`, you likely need to install its package first. If the package name is `atproto`, install it via pip:

```bash
pip install atproto
```

------------ so this is only bluesky ?
ChatGPT
Yes, the code snippet using `AtprotoClient` is primarily designed for platforms built on the **AT Protocol** ecosystem. As of now, **Bluesky Social** is the most prominent platform utilizing the AT Protocol. While the protocol itself is open and can be adopted by other decentralized social networks in the future, Bluesky is the primary use case.

---

### Key Points:
1. **AT Protocol**:
   - A decentralized social networking protocol.
   - Designed to allow users to move their data and identity between services.
   - Promotes interoperability and data ownership.

2. **Bluesky Social**:
   - A social media platform leveraging the AT Protocol.
   - Similar in feel to Twitter but decentralized in architecture.
   - Supports features like posts, feeds, and profile management.

---

### Does It Work Only for Bluesky?
- **For Now**: Yes, it is tailored for Bluesky since it's the main adopter of the AT Protocol.
- **In the Future**: Other platforms might also adopt the AT Protocol. If they do, the same or similar clients (like `AtprotoClient`) could be used for those platforms.

If you‚Äôre looking to use the `AtprotoClient` for Bluesky or another AT Protocol-based platform, the code is directly relevant. If your needs extend to other platforms (e.g., Twitter, Mastodon, Reddit), different libraries would be required.

how do i post to mastadon
ChatGPT
To post to **Mastodon**, you can use the `Mastodon.py` library, which is a Python wrapper for Mastodon's API. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

---

### 1. **Install the Library**
```bash
pip install Mastodon.py
```

---

### 2. **Create an App on Mastodon**
You need to register your app to get access credentials:
1. Go to your Mastodon instance (e.g., `https://mastodon.social`).
2. Log in and navigate to **Preferences > Development > New application**.
3. Create a new application, set permissions (like posting toots), and note down your **access token**.

---

### 3. **Python Code to Post to Mastodon**
Here's an example of how you can post a toot (a Mastodon post):

```python
from mastodon import Mastodon

# Initialize Mastodon API client
mastodon = Mastodon(
    access_token="your_access_token",  # Replace with your access token
    api_base_url="https://mastodon.social"  # Replace with your instance URL
)

# Create a post (toot)
try:
    toot_text = "Hello, Mastodon! This is my first post via Python. üêò"
    response = mastodon.status_post(toot_text)
    print("Post created successfully!")
    print(f"Post URL: {response['url']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error while posting to Mastodon: {e}")
```

---

### 4. **Breakdown of the Code**
1. **Import the Library**: Import the `Mastodon` class from `mastodon`.
2. **Initialize the Client**: Use `access_token` and your Mastodon instance's URL.
3. **Post a Toot**: Use the `status_post` method to create a post.

---

### 5. **Additional Features**
- **Add Media to Posts**:
   ```python
   media = mastodon.media_post("path/to/image.jpg", "image description")
   mastodon.status_post("Here‚Äôs a post with an image!", media_ids=[media])
   ```
- **Fetch Timelines**:
   ```python
   timeline = mastodon.timeline_home()
   for post in timeline:
       print(f"{post['account']['display_name']}: {post['content']}")
   ```

- **Follow a User**:
   ```python
   mastodon.account_follow("account_id")
   ```

---

### 6. **Helpful Tips**
- Replace `"https://mastodon.social"` with the URL of your Mastodon instance.
- Keep your **access token** secure, as it allows access to your Mastodon account.

Let me know if you need help with any specific Mastodon functionality!
user
by access token you mean password ?
ChatGPT
No, an **access token** is **not** the same as your password. Here's the difference:

---

### **Access Token vs. Password**
1. **Password**:
   - The secret you use to log in to your Mastodon account.
   - Should never be shared or hard-coded into scripts.
   - It gives full access to your account, including sensitive areas like account settings.

2. **Access Token**:
   - A unique key generated by Mastodon when you create an application in the "Development" section of your Mastodon account.
   - Used by your application (or script) to authenticate and interact with Mastodon's API.
   - Provides limited access based on the permissions you specify when creating the app (e.g., posting toots, reading timelines).
   - Safer than using your password directly because you can revoke it at any time without affecting your main login.

---

### How to Get an Access Token
1. Log in to your Mastodon instance (e.g., `https://mastodon.social`).
2. Go to **Preferences > Development > New Application**.
3. Fill in details like the application's name and permissions (e.g., "write:statuses" for posting).
4. After creating the app, you‚Äôll see an **access token**. Copy it.

---

### Why Use an Access Token?
- It‚Äôs more secure than using your password.
- You can control the token's permissions and revoke it if necessary without impacting your account.
- Tokens follow the OAuth2 authentication flow, standard for APIs.

---

If you‚Äôre concerned about securely managing your token, you can:
- Store it in an environment variable using a `.env` file.
- Use libraries like `os` to read the token dynamically:
   ```python
   import os
   from mastodon import Mastodon
   
   mastodon = Mastodon(
       access_token=os.getenv("MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN"),
       api_base_url="https://mastodon.social"
   )
   ```

)

# Create a post (toot)
try:
    toot_text = "TESTING a hidden key. üêò"
    response = mastodon.status_post(toot_text)
    print("Post created successfully!")
    print(f"Post URL: {response['url']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error while posting to Mastodon: {e}")

TypeError: stat: path should be string, bytes, os.PathLike or integer, not tuple
why this error ?
ChatGPT
The error occurs because in your `mastadonkey` function, you are using a **comma** after `access_token="XXXXxx"`, which turns the return value into a **tuple** instead of a string.

---

### Problem in `mastadonkey`
Here‚Äôs your function:
```python
def mastadonkey():
    access_token="XXXXxx",
    return access_token
```

- The **comma** after `"XXXXxx"` creates a **tuple** with one element instead of returning the string directly.
- This makes `mastodon = Mastodon(access_token=mastadonkey(), ...)` receive a tuple instead of a string, causing the `TypeError`.

---

### Solution: Fix `mastadonkey`
Remove the trailing comma:
```python
def mastadonkey():
    access_token = "XXXXxx"  # No comma here
    return access_token
```

---

### Updated Code
After fixing the function, your main script should work as expected:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append("/home/jack/hidden")
from mastadon_key import mastadonkey
from mastodon import Mastodon

# Initialize Mastodon API client
mastodon = Mastodon(
    access_token=mastadonkey(),  # Correctly retrieves the string
    api_base_url="https://mastodon.social"  # Replace with your instance URL
)

# Create a post (toot)
try:
    toot_text = "TESTING a hidden key. üêò"
    response = mastodon.status_post(toot_text)
    print("Post created successfully!")
    print(f"Post URL: {response['url']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error while posting to Mastodon: {e}")
```

---

### Explanation
- **Before**: `mastadonkey()` was returning `("XXXXxx",)` (a tuple).
- **After Fix**: `mastadonkey()` now correctly returns `"XXXXxx"` (a string), which `Mastodon` expects for `access_token`.

user
that is working good.
now how do i post an image
ChatGPT
To post an image to Mastodon along with a toot, you can use the `media_post` method provided by the `Mastodon.py` library. Here's how you can do it:

---

### Steps to Post an Image

1. **Upload the Image**: Use the `media_post` method to upload the image to Mastodon.
2. **Attach the Media**: Pass the `media_ids` returned from `media_post` to the `status_post` method when creating the toot.

---

### Full Example Code

```python
import sys
sys.path.append("/home/jack/hidden")
from mastadon_key import mastadonkey
from mastodon import Mastodon

# Initialize Mastodon API client
mastodon = Mastodon(
    access_token=mastadonkey(),
    api_base_url="https://mastodon.social"
)

# Path to the image
image_path = "/path/to/your/image.jpg"

try:
    # Step 1: Upload the image
    media = mastodon.media_post(image_path, description="A beautiful image")  # Add an image description for accessibility

    # Step 2: Create a toot with the image
    toot_text = "Here is an image post with Python! üñºÔ∏è"
    response = mastodon.status_post(toot_text, media_ids=[media['id']])

    print("Image post created successfully!")
    print(f"Post URL: {response['url']}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error while posting image to Mastodon: {e}")
```

---

### Key Points
1. **Image Path**: Replace `/path/to/your/image.jpg` with the actual path to your image.
2. **Image Description**: The `description` parameter in `media_post` is important for accessibility (screen readers for visually impaired users).
3. **Media ID**: The `media_post` method returns a dictionary. Use `media['id']` to get the media ID for attaching to the toot.

---

### Output
The toot will contain the text "Here is an image post with Python! üñºÔ∏è" along with the uploaded image.

----------------------------- how do i fix what i have ?

ChatGPT
Your code is set up well but needs adjustments to handle posting images (thumbnails) correctly to Mastodon. I'll guide you through fixing the issues and improving the workflow.

---

### Key Issues in Your Code
1. **Thumbnail Handling in `post_to_mastadone`**:
   - The function does not handle attaching the thumbnail (image) to the Mastodon post.
   - `thumbnail_blob_ref` is passed but not used.

2. **Return Value from `post_to_mastadone`**:
   - The function does not explicitly return a success or failure flag (`True`/`False`), but your Flask route expects it.

3. **Unused Variables**:
   - `video_link` is retrieved in `upload_to_mastadon` but not used.

4. **Redundancy**:
   - You're resizing and optimizing thumbnails, but the optimized thumbnail isn't being posted to Mastodon.

---

### Fixed and Improved Code

#### `post_to_mastadone` Function
Modify `post_to_mastadone` to handle images properly:

```python
def post_to_mastadone(text_status, thumbnail_path=None):
    from mastodon import Mastodon

    mastodon = Mastodon(access_token=mastadonkey(), api_base_url="https://mastodon.social")

    try:
        media_ids = None

        # Upload thumbnail to Mastodon if provided
        if thumbnail_path:
            media = mastodon.media_post(thumbnail_path, description="Thumbnail image for the post")
            media_ids = [media['id']]

        # Create the post (toot)
        response = mastodon.status_post(status=text_status, media_ids=media_ids)
        print("Post created successfully!")
        print(f"Post URL: {response['url']}")
        return True  # Indicate success
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error while posting to Mastodon: {e}")
        return False  # Indicate failure
```

---

#### `upload_to_mastadon` Route
Update your Flask route to handle the posting flow:

```python
@app.route('/upload_to_mastadon', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_to_mastadon():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        text_status = request.form.get('text', '').strip()
        thumbnail_file = request.files.get('thumbnail')

        thumbnail_path = None

        # Handle the thumbnail file if provided
        if thumbnail_file and allowed_file(thumbnail_file.filename, ALLOWED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS):
            thumbnail_filename = secure_filename(thumbnail_file.filename)
            thumbnail_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_BFOLDER'], thumbnail_filename)
            thumbnail_file.save(thumbnail_path)

            # Resize and optimize the image
            thumbnail_path = resize_and_optimize_image(thumbnail_path)

        # Post to Mastodon with optional thumbnail
        success = post_to_mastadone(text_status, thumbnail_path)

        if thumbnail_path:
            os.remove(thumbnail_path)  # Clean up the uploaded file

        if success:
            flash('Post created successfully on Mastodon!')
        else:
            flash('Failed to create the post on Mastodon.')

        return redirect(request.url)

    return render_template('mastadon_uploads.html')
```

---

### Key Changes and Fixes
1. **Image Upload in `post_to_mastadone`**:
   - The `thumbnail_path` is uploaded to Mastodon using `media_post` with an accessibility description.

2. **Error Handling and Return Values**:
   - `post_to_mastadone` now returns `True` on success and `False` on failure, which the Flask route uses to display appropriate messages.

3. **Temporary File Cleanup**:
   - After posting to Mastodon, the uploaded thumbnail is deleted to avoid cluttering the server.

4. **Optional Thumbnail**:
   - The post works whether or not a thumbnail is provided.

---

### Example Workflow
1. **Input Form**:
   - Users upload a thumbnail and enter a status text.
   - The form calls `/upload_to_mastadon`.

2. **Thumbnail Handling**:
   - The uploaded image is saved, resized, optimized, and posted to Mastodon.

3. **Post to Mastodon**:
   - The `text_status` and optional `thumbnail_path` are sent to Mastodon.
   - If successful, the user sees a success message; otherwise, an error message.

---

### Flask Template (Example `mastadon_uploads.html`)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

### Notes
- Ensure `resize_and_optimize_image()` correctly optimizes the image and returns the file path of the resized image.
- Update `allowed_file()` and `ALLOWED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` to validate file types like `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.
- If `video_link` is necessary for future features, you can expand the code to handle videos.

I am never 100% happy ha ha now i want a choice to also post video.
not required just a choice.
ChatGPT
Got it! Let‚Äôs enhance your code to allow the **optional upload of videos** along with the text and thumbnail image. Users can upload a video in addition to the image (or choose to skip both). If a video is provided, it will be uploaded to Mastodon using the `media_post` method, just like the thumbnail.

Here‚Äôs how we can modify the implementation:

---

### Updated Code

#### Modify `post_to_mastadone` to Handle Videos
We'll enhance the function to accept both **thumbnail_path** and **video_path**:

```python
def post_to_mastadone(text_status, thumbnail_path=None, video_path=None):
    from mastodon import Mastodon

    mastodon = Mastodon(access_token=mastadonkey(), api_base_url="https://mastodon.social")

    try:
        media_ids = []

        # Upload thumbnail to Mastodon if provided
        if thumbnail_path:
            thumbnail_media = mastodon.media_post(thumbnail_path, description="Thumbnail image for the post")
            media_ids.append(thumbnail_media['id'])

        # Upload video to Mastodon if provided
        if video_path:
            video_media = mastodon.media_post(video_path, description="Video for the post")
            media_ids.append(video_media['id'])

        # Create the post (toot)
        response = mastodon.status_post(status=text_status, media_ids=media_ids)
        print("Post created successfully!")
        print(f"Post URL: {response['url']}")
        return True  # Indicate success
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error while posting to Mastodon: {e}")
        return False  # Indicate failure
```

---

#### Update Flask Route to Handle Video Uploads
We'll allow users to upload a video and pass its path to the `post_to_mastadone` function.

```python
@app.route('/upload_to_mastadon', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_to_mastadon():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        text_status = request.form.get('text', '').strip()
        thumbnail_file = request.files.get('thumbnail')
        video_file = request.files.get('video')

        thumbnail_path = None
        video_path = None

        # Handle the thumbnail file if provided
        if thumbnail_file and allowed_file(thumbnail_file.filename, ALLOWED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS):
            thumbnail_filename = secure_filename(thumbnail_file.filename)
            thumbnail_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_BFOLDER'], thumbnail_filename)
            thumbnail_file.save(thumbnail_path)

            # Resize and optimize the image
            thumbnail_path = resize_and_optimize_image(thumbnail_path)

        # Handle the video file if provided
        if video_file and allowed_file(video_file.filename, ALLOWED_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS):
            video_filename = secure_filename(video_file.filename)
            video_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_BFOLDER'], video_filename)
            video_file.save(video_path)

        # Post to Mastodon with optional thumbnail and video
        success = post_to_mastadone(text_status, thumbnail_path, video_path)

        # Clean up temporary files
        if thumbnail_path:
            os.remove(thumbnail_path)
        if video_path:
            os.remove(video_path)

        if success:
            flash('Post created successfully on Mastodon!')
        else:
            flash('Failed to create the post on Mastodon.')

        return redirect(request.url)

    return render_template('mastadon_uploads.html')
```

---

#### Update Flask Template (`mastadon_uploads.html`)
Add an input field for video uploads:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Upload to Mastodon</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Post to Mastodon</h1>
    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <label for="text">Post Text:</label><br>
        <textarea id="text" name="text" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea><br><br>
        
        <label for="thumbnail">Thumbnail Image:</label>
        <input type="file" id="thumbnail" name="thumbnail" accept="image/*"><br><br>

        <label for="video">Video:</label>
        <input type="file" id="video" name="video" accept="video/*"><br><br>

        <button type="submit">Post to Mastodon</button>
    </form>
    {% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
      {% if messages %}
        <ul>
        {% for message in messages %}
          <li>{{ message }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
        </ul>
      {% endif %}
    {% endwith %}
</body>
</html>
```

---

### Key Enhancements
1. **Optional Video Upload**:
   - Users can now upload a video in addition to (or instead of) a thumbnail image.
   - The `media_post` method handles the video upload similarly to images.

2. **MIME Type Validation**:
   - Ensure `allowed_file()` is updated to validate video file extensions (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, etc.).

3. **Flexible Posting**:
   - Supports posting with:
     - Text only.
     - Text + Thumbnail.
     - Text + Video.
     - Text + Thumbnail + Video.

4. **File Cleanup**:
   - Deletes temporary thumbnail and video files after posting.

---

### `allowed_file()` Function
Update this function to validate both image and video files:

```python
ALLOWED_IMAGE_EXTENSIONS = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'}
ALLOWED_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS = {'mp4', 'mov', 'avi', 'mkv'}

def allowed_file(filename, allowed_extensions):
    return '.' in filename and filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in allowed_extensions
```

---

### Example Workflow
1. User navigates to `/upload_to_mastadon`.
2. Fills in the text, optionally uploads a thumbnail and/or video, and clicks **Post to Mastodon**.
3. Flask handles:
   - Resizing/optimizing the thumbnail.
   - Saving the video file.
   - Uploading both (if provided) to Mastodon.
4. Mastodon receives the post with text, thumbnail, and/or video.
5. Temporary files are cleaned up on the server.

---

### Try it Out!
With this setup, users now have a **choice** to post videos, thumbnails, or just text. Let me know if you need further refinements! üòä

do i have to size or optimize my video ?
ChatGPT
It depends on Mastodon's **video upload requirements** and the size of the videos you plan to upload. Mastodon has limits on file size, video duration, and supported formats. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### Mastodon Video Upload Requirements
1. **File Size Limit**:
   - Mastodon instances generally have a **file size limit** for uploads. The default is **40 MB**, but some instances may allow larger files. Check with your Mastodon instance admin (e.g., `mastodon.social`).

2. **Supported Formats**:
   - Commonly supported video formats are **MP4** and **WebM**.
   - Videos should use codecs like **H.264** for video and **AAC** for audio.

3. **Duration**:
   - Many instances restrict video duration to around **60 seconds** by default.

4. **Resolution**:
   - There is no hard resolution limit, but keeping videos at **720p (1280x720)** or lower ensures compatibility and faster uploads.

---

### When Should You Resize or Optimize?
You **must** resize/optimize your videos if:
1. **File size exceeds the limit**: If your video is larger than the allowed size (e.g., 40 MB).
2. **Duration exceeds the limit**: If your video is longer than the allowed duration (e.g., 60 seconds).
3. **Incompatible format**: If your video is not in a supported format (e.g., MOV or MKV).

---

### How to Resize or Optimize Videos
You can use tools like **FFmpeg**, a popular open-source tool for video processing, to resize, reformat, and compress videos.

#### Example: Resize and Compress a Video with FFmpeg
```bash
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf scale=1280:720 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 28 -c:a aac -strict experimental -b:a 128k output_video.mp4
```

Explanation:
- `-vf scale=1280:720`: Resizes the video to 720p.
- `-c:v libx264`: Encodes the video using the H.264 codec.
- `-preset fast`: Sets the encoding speed/quality tradeoff.
- `-crf 28`: Adjusts the compression level (lower is higher quality, higher is more compressed).
- `-c:a aac`: Encodes audio using the AAC codec.
- `-b:a 128k`: Sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps.

#### Python Example: Automate with FFmpeg in Your Flask App
You can integrate FFmpeg into your Flask app to process videos before uploading them to Mastodon:

```python
import subprocess
import os

def resize_and_optimize_video(input_path, output_path, max_width=1280, max_height=720):
    try:
        # Use FFmpeg to resize and compress the video
        command = [
            "ffmpeg",
            "-i", input_path,
            "-vf", f"scale='min({max_width},iw)':min'({max_height},ih)':force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease",
            "-c:v", "libx264",
            "-preset", "fast",
            "-crf", "28",
            "-c:a", "aac",
            "-b:a", "128k",
            output_path
        ]
        subprocess.run(command, check=True)
        return output_path
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error resizing video: {e}")
        return None
```

#### Usage in Flask
Call this function before uploading the video to Mastodon:

```python
if video_file and allowed_file(video_file.filename, ALLOWED_VIDEO_EXTENSIONS):
    video_filename = secure_filename(video_file.filename)
    video_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_BFOLDER'], video_filename)
    video_file.save(video_path)

    # Resize and optimize the video
    optimized_video_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_BFOLDER'], f"optimized_{video_filename}")
    video_path = resize_and_optimize_video(video_path, optimized_video_path)

    if not video_path:
        flash("Failed to process video. Please try again.")
```

---

### What If You Don't Optimize?
- **Large Videos**: The upload may fail if the video exceeds the size limit.
- **Incompatible Format**: The Mastodon server will reject unsupported formats.
- **User Experience**: Large files take longer to upload, and viewers may face playback issues.

---

### Recommendation
To ensure smooth uploads and compatibility:
1. **Optimize videos** using FFmpeg or a similar tool before uploading.
2. **Automate optimization** in your Flask app.
3. **Check instance-specific limits** (e.g., file size, duration) and validate the video before posting.

I have a directory of many text files how can i get the average number of words in a text file within directory simplest way
ChatGPT
Here's the simplest way to calculate the average number of words in all text files within a directory in Python:

### Code:
```python
import os

def get_average_words_in_files(directory):
    total_words = 0
    total_files = 0

    # Iterate through all files in the directory
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith(".txt"):  # Only process .txt files
            file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
            with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                words = file.read().split()  # Split by whitespace to get words
                total_words += len(words)
                total_files += 1

    # Calculate average words per file
    if total_files == 0:
        return 0  # Avoid division by zero if no .txt files
    return total_words / total_files

# Example usage
directory_path = "/path/to/your/text/files"
average_words = get_average_words_in_files(directory_path)
print(f"Average number of words per text file: {average_words}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **`os.listdir(directory)`**: Lists all files in the given directory.
2. **`filename.endswith(".txt")`**: Filters for `.txt` files only.
3. **Read file content**: Opens each text file and reads its content.
4. **Split into words**: Uses `split()` to count words.
5. **Calculate average**: Divides total word count by the number of `.txt` files.

### Output:
The script will print the average number of words in all text files in the specified directory.
