Rsync file overwrite behavior
user
rsync -avz -e ssh --log-file=rsync-log.txt --no-links /mnt/HDD500/Flask_Make_Art/ jack@192.168.1.112:/home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art

This will overwrite existing files with changes but keep any deleted files correct ?
ChatGPT
Yes, your command will **overwrite existing files** in the destination (`/home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art`) with the updated versions from the source (`/mnt/HDD500/Flask_Make_Art`) but will **not delete any files** on the destination that do not exist in the source.

### Key Points:
- **Files with the same name**: Updated in the destination if they differ from the source.
- **Files deleted from the source**: **Will remain in the destination** since you haven't added the `--delete` flag.
- **New files in the source**: Copied to the destination.

If you want the destination to exactly mirror the source (deleting files in the destination that are not present in the source), you need to add the `--delete` option to your command:
```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh --log-file=rsync-log.txt --no-links --delete /mnt/HDD500/Flask_Make_Art/ jack@192.168.1.112:/home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art
```

Would you like to preserve the current behavior or modify it to include deletions?

I like the current behavior, I was just checking.
ChatGPT
Got it, Jack! Your current command is perfect for ensuring that updated and new files are synced while **keeping existing files in the destination** that may no longer exist in the source. It's great for situations where you want to back up or sync changes without losing older files on the destination.

how can i get the free space human readable on the destination using ssh
ChatGPT
To check the free space on the destination server in a human-readable format using SSH, you can use the `df` (disk free) command. Here's how:

### Command
```bash
ssh jack@192.168.1.112 'df -h /home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art'
```

### Explanation
1. **`ssh jack@192.168.1.112`**: Connects to the destination server via SSH.
2. **`df -h /home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art`**:
   - `df`: Displays disk space usage.
   - `-h`: Outputs sizes in a human-readable format (e.g., GB, MB).
   - `/home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art`: Checks the disk usage for the specific directory or partition.

### Sample Output
You might see something like this:
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1       100G   60G   40G  60% /
```
This tells you:
- **Size**: Total size of the filesystem.
- **Used**: Space already used.
- **Avail**: Free space available.
- **Use%**: Percentage of disk usage.
- **Mounted on**: The mount point of the filesystem.

if the directory on the server does not exit does this command create it ?
ChatGPT
No, your `rsync` command will **not create the destination directory** (`/home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art`) on the remote server if it does not already exist. If the directory doesn't exist, `rsync` will return an error like:

```
rsync: change_dir "/home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art" failed: No such file or directory (2)
```

### To Ensure the Directory is Created:
You can use the `--rsync-path` flag to create the directory automatically by combining `mkdir -p` (make directory if it doesnâ€™t exist) with `rsync`. Hereâ€™s how:

### Updated Command:
```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh --log-file=rsync-log.txt --no-links --rsync-path="mkdir -p /home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art && rsync" /mnt/HDD500/Flask_Make_Art/ jack@192.168.1.112:/home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art
```

### What This Does:
1. **`mkdir -p /home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art`**:
   - Ensures the directory is created if it doesn't exist.
   - Does nothing if the directory already exists.
2. **`&& rsync`**: Runs `rsync` only after successfully creating the directory.

### Alternative Option:
If you prefer a manual check, you can log in to the remote server and create the directory first:
```bash
ssh jack@192.168.1.112 'mkdir -p /home/jack/Desktop/Flask_Make_Art'
```
Then run your original `rsync` command.
